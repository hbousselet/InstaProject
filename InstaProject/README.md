# Nasa Instagram

## Description
As a big fan of planets I was seeking for a social network where I will be able to check all the new photos published by the Nasa. I also wanted to be able to like them and to share them with my friends, that's now possible with this application.

## Architetural
MVVM architecture with swiftUI framework. No external library used. 

## Limitation
Not able to properly store the isLiked property .. but I save every new fetch locally (also when a like is triggered but like is not saved..)
